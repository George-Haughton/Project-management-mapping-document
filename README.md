### Aims and Objectives

#### Aims
I am going to be talking about my Capstone project which was to design, develop and build a game, that was a reboot of a classic retro game, for example games like Tetris, Mario and Pacman. Additionally, it will need to be our own version of the game, so in essence it can have features of the base retro game but will need to have clear differences and our own twist be shown clearly.

1. During this project i will aim to make a rebooted version of the retro classic Mario, adding my own features

2. Within this project i will aim to add an upgrade system with my game, that will help give the player the option to upgrade their characters: health, jump height, damage and moveent speed.

3. I will be aiming for this game to have levels that will gradually get harder as the player progresses throughout them; with different and harder enemies/obstacles.

4. I aim for my game to include at least 3 different NPCs/enemies that players can interact with for example by either being able to damage them or be damaged by them.

5. Within my game i aim for the players run/level time to be displayed on the screen.

#### Project objectives

1. To make this project happen i will need to create a project plan that will guide me through the project in its entirety. I will need to make sure i plan out every aspect of my project, for example what parts i will be completing, what date i would like these parts completed by and what resources i may need to make this project happen. These can come in the form of Gannt charts, work breakdowns and project managment plans.

2. To make sure there is an upgrade system within my game i will need to create a database that will contain the characters base abilities/stats, then as the player collects upgrades the characters stats will slowly rise and become better/higher. Additionally, i will be using game manager to have control over the the players data and things like loading screens. Finally, i will make sure every upgrade i add, the code for this upgrade is implemented and working with the characters code well.
