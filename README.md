### 1.2 Aims and Objectives

#### Aims
I am going to be talking about my Capstone project which was to design, develop and build a game, that was a reboot of a classic retro game, for example games like Tetris, Mario and Pacman. Additionally, it will need to be our own version of the game, so in essence it can have features of the base retro game but will need to have clear differences and our own twist be shown clearly.

1. During this project i will aim to make a rebooted version of the retro classic Mario, adding my own features

2. Within this project i will aim to add an upgrade system with my game, that will help give the player the option to upgrade their characters: health, jump height, damage and moveent speed.

3. I will be aiming for this game to have levels that will gradually get harder as the player progresses throughout them; with different and harder enemies/obstacles.

4. I aim for my game to include at least 3 different NPCs/enemies that players can interact with for example by either being able to damage them or be damaged by them.

5. Within my game i aim for the players run/level time to be displayed on the screen.

#### Project objectives

1. To make this project happen i will need to create a project plan that will guide me through the project in its entirety. I will need to make sure i plan out every aspect of my project, for example what parts i will be completing, what date i would like these parts completed by and what resources i may need to make this project happen. These can come in the form of Gannt charts, work breakdowns and project managment plans. When i have a clear outline of how i can complete this project this objective will be complete.

2. To make sure there is an upgrade system within my game i will need to create a database that will contain the characters base abilities/stats, then as the player collects upgrades the characters stats will slowly rise and become better/higher. Additionally, i will be using game manager to have control over the the players data and things like loading screens. Finally, i will make sure every upgrade i add, the code for this upgrade is implemented and working with the characters code well. When i have a system where the player can improve their character this objective will be complete.

3. To make sure my levels are different and get progressibly harder i will be using Unity to design each level. I will make sure each level has different obstacles that either make the level harder or different from the last one. Additionally, i will compare each level to the last and make sure each level has its own unique feature within it, and if each level is unique in its own way this objective will be complete.

4. I will be using Unity to design each charater/NPC; while doing this i will make sure each NPC is designed well, looks fun/cool and finally look good enough that people are excited to fight against them. Firstly i will design them on paper to brainstorm how i would like them to look, move and interact with the character in battle. This will make it easier when it comes to developing them as i will already have a good idea at what i would like to achieve with these NPCs. When i have at least 3 NPCs that re all up to a high standard this objective will be complete.

5. Within unity i will create a professional looking timer that will be placed in a visable place on the game screen. This timer will immediately start as the player starts the level and will end when the player completes the level. This timer will available at the main menu within a tab called 'previous runs' so the player can see how long it took them and to aim to beat it next time. Finally, i will also need to create a database that will harbour these run times of the player's. When i have a timer that times the players run correctly and a database that holds these times this objective will be complete.

### 2 Project management plan

Scrum is a framework/way of addressing hard problems to overcome and adapt to a complex criteria or problem while still being able to provide a high standard of work or product. It helps groups, individuals and businesses to work on complex problems or team collaboration within a join goal, such as creating and application. An advantages of Scrum is that it is easy to understand and get to grips with but a disadvantage is that it can be difficult to master.

Within this project i will be using scrum to break down my project into smaller more managable pieces that i can more easily handle and complete, while still holding up a high standard for my project. Additionally, i will use Scrum to prioritise the pieces of work that are more imporant or may need more time to be completed so i will use Scrum to make sure i keep on top of these parts while again making sure i keep that high standard.

#### 2.1 Introduction
I will be producing a management plan about our ZSL client (london zoo) where we were asked to design and develop a game based around 4 habitats. ZSL are going to use it to help them teach the 11-16 year olds that come into the zoo. It would give the children a more engaging and interactive session; which ZSL hopes will help the student to better understand the work and increase the chances of them remembering and learning more.

Now i am going to talk about different aspects of my Project that all had an involvment within my project:

### 2.2 Cost
There are a few things we are going to look at that relate to cost within this project. Firstly, we will look at the cost of the systems we used. These would be the cost of the computers we used during class and my personal system I have at home. The systems at the college cost around £1500 and these were perfect as they had the exact tools we needed, the exact computer specifications that would support what we needed to do and they were also the computers we knew well as we had used them in past projects; and as there were 4 in our group so the costs together would be $6000. Additionally, my home computer is a lot more equipped for this project as I know the ins and outs of it and its computer specifications are a lot more up to date and considerably more power than the ones we have at college. This system costs £1200 which puts our system costs at £7200. Secondly, I’m going to speak about the costs of the time it took for us to complete the project. As we were using this project as a learning experience and not as a profit gain we worked for free as we thought this would benefit us a lot more, because we wanted to improve ourselves as programmers and didn’t feel we were ready to charge them and didn’t feel it necessary or fair. Thirdly, I will discuss the software that we used to complete this project. The standard software that we used were Microsoft word to write down notes, feedback and the requirements and we used power point to create a presentation of our ideas for ZSL (London Zoo) and finally, we used google docs as a way of keeping everyone up to date on the work, as google doc allows us all to work on a document at the same time which updates the document with the new work that has been added. These were both completely free which helped us a lot. Additionally, the main software we used was Unity which is a game developing platform, we used this to create our concept art and create the animations for the game. This license costs around £125 per person for one month, and a we had four group members it would come to a total of £500; so the total system costs are £500. Fourthly, our lecturer took a coach driving course so he could drive us to the London Zoo, I could not find out how much this course cost but this is the way we got to the Zoo and back and we were not told how much it cost as the college paid for the travel and things of this nature. Lastly, we needed a stable internet connection for us to carry out our research and as we were at college we do not know how much it cost them to provide us with it but as I did work at home using the internet I have there; I can use this to calculate how much was spent on internet access. My internet costs £30 per month which puts our known internet cost for the project at £30.

### 2.3 Scope
The main objective of this project was to create a fun, interactive game that the ZSL (London Zoo) teachers/staff could use to better their classes and make sure the 11-16 year olds learnt more, were more engaged throughout the lesson and overall make the children enjoy the lesson a lot more.  The game will consist of 4 habitats which the user/child can pick one at a time which one they would like to play through. Each habitat will have a chain that the users/children will have to complete by dragging the correct part of the chain in its correct position within the chain. As a helping hand we will give them the first part/start and the last/end of the chain; just so they have a small idea of what to do and not confused.

### 2.4 Time
This project had a very small time duration with it. We had 5 weeks in total to design, develop and build the app for ZSL. The first 2 weeks were spent designing all of the images, coming up with ideas and concepts for the game and completing all of our design documentation for the project. Additionally, the first 2 weeks were used to create presentation that we would use to present our ideas to show ZSL our ideas, examples of concept art, how the game would play out, how to play and working prototypes so ZSL could test drive 
our game. The third and fourth weeks were used by used to starting developing and building the actual game. We finalised all of the imagery/concept art and got to work on coding the game from the ground up. Finally, we used the last week to finalize everything, from each line of code to making sure our all of our documentation was complete in full.

### 2.5 Quality
This project meant a alot to everyone in the class as it was our first real client, so we wanted to make sure we made ZSL exceptionally happy with our app. This was was an important project so we needed to make sure we created something that was as professional and high quality as possible. At the end of the project we felt proud of the app we had made as we felt its quality was of a high standard.

### 2.6 Communication
As stated in my Quality (1.6) section before this was a very important project and we wanted to make sure everyone knew what they should be doing and when it should be completed by to descrease the risk of something going wrong and setting us back which is something we could not afford to happen as we did not have much time. Throughout the whole project we made sure everyone was up to date with what was happening. We did this by creating a group chat so we could all communicate effectively with one another. Additionally, we would email/message each other to check up on each other and make sure everyone was on the same page.

### 2.7 Risks
As we did not charge our first client there were only a few consequences/risks that come with failing this project. The most important would be our reputation. As ZSL were our first real client we wanted to make a good impression within the game developing community. If we did not stay true to our word and give them a professional, working app then our reputation would be affected hugely. On the other hand if we did stay true it would path the way for future projects and future clients; as people would find out from ZSL that we are able to design, develop and produce a professional looking app/game. Finally, the other risk/consequence is time. If we dont please our client we risk wasting a huge amount of time which could have been spent elsewhere, for instance on another client we were more fitted for.


| Risk | Impact | Probability of occuring out of 10 | Severity of risk out of 10 |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Ruining Reputation | This being our first client means everything, if we ruin our reputation because we fail to deliver no other company is to want to work with us and we ruin all hope at become a successful company | Probability of 5 as we may fail or we may not | Severity of 8 as losing reputation for us would be huge |
| Losing money/making a loss | If a business puts money into something they expect a return of proift or a figure of similar size from what they invested, as we did not charge ZSL we were not worried about making money or losing money | probabilty of 0 as we did not invest any money                         | Severity of 0 as it can not affect as   |
| Time     | Losing time that we could have invested in something that may have been more successful/beneficial for us is negative as it is just a pure waste if we get nothing from this | Probabilty of 5 as it depends if we fail or succed on the project                       | Severity of 6 as losing time and failing the project, where the time could have been spent elsewhere is very negative |








### 2.8 Resources
As explain within the Cost (1.1) section we used various tools, techniques and software to make sure we did not displease our client. For instance we used Microsoft Office (Word, Powerpoint, google docs) to complete our documentation and to produce our powerpoint we used to show ZSL our ideas and concept art. We used our interent access to research everything we needed to know about the age ranges (11-16 year olds) that would using/playing our app/game. We used Unity to create the core game mechanics of the game/app. In addition to this we used Adobe photoshop to create our images and concept art for our game/app. The last resource and arguably the most imporant one were the systems we used. This consisted of the computers we used at college and my home computer, which i speak more about in Costs (1.1). These systems were the back bone of our whole project and may not have even been able to start the project if we did not have systems like this that harboured the power and system specifications that we needed to complete this project.
