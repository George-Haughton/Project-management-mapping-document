### Aims and Objectives

#### Aims
I am going to be talking about my Capstone project which was to design, develop and build a game, that was a reboot of a classic retro game, for example games like Tetris, Mario and Pacman. Additionally, it will need to be our own version of the game, so in essence it can have features of the base retro game but will need to have clear differences and our own twist be shown clearly.

1. During this project i will aim to make a rebooted version of the retro classic Mario, adding my own features

2. Within this project i will aim to add an upgrade system with my game, that will help give the player the option to upgrade their characters: health, jump height, damage and moveent speed.

3. I will be aiming for this game to have levels that will gradually get harder as the player progresses throughout them; with different and harder enemies/obstacles.

4. I aim for my game to include at least 3 different NPCs/enemies that players can interact with for example by either being able to damage them or be damaged by them.

5. Within my game i aim for the players run/level time to be displayed on the screen.

#### Project objectives

1. To make this project happen i will need to create a project plan that will guide me through the project in its entirety. I will need to make sure i plan out every aspect of my project, for example what parts i will be completing, what date i would like these parts completed by and what resources i may need to make this project happen. These can come in the form of Gannt charts, work breakdowns and project managment plans. When i have a clear outline of how i can complete this project this objective will be complete.

2. To make sure there is an upgrade system within my game i will need to create a database that will contain the characters base abilities/stats, then as the player collects upgrades the characters stats will slowly rise and become better/higher. Additionally, i will be using game manager to have control over the the players data and things like loading screens. Finally, i will make sure every upgrade i add, the code for this upgrade is implemented and working with the characters code well. When i have a system where the player can improve their character this objective will be complete.

3. To make sure my levels are different and get progressibly harder i will be using Unity to design each level. I will make sure each level has different obstacles that either make the level harder or different from the last one. Additionally, i will compare each level to the last and make sure each level has its own unique feature within it, and if each level is unique in its own way this objective will be complete.

4. I will be using Unity to design each charater/NPC; while doing this i will make sure each NPC is designed well, looks fun/cool and finally look good enough that people are excited to fight against them. Firstly i will design them on paper to brainstorm how i would like them to look, move and interact with the character in battle. This will make it easier when it comes to developing them as i will already have a good idea at what i would like to achieve with these NPCs. When i have at least 3 NPCs that re all up to a high standard this objective will be complete.

5. Within unity i will create a professional looking timer that will be placed in a visable place on the game screen. This timer will immediately start as the player starts the level and will end when the player completes the level. This timer will available at the main menu within a tab called 'previous runs' so the player can see how long it took them and to aim to beat it next time. Finally, i will also need to create a database that will harbour these run times of the player's. When i have a timer that times the players run correctly and a database that holds these times this objective will be complete.

### Project management plan

Scrum is a framework/way of addressing hard problems to overcome and adapt to a complex criteria or problem while still being able to provide a high standard of work or product. It helps groups, individuals and businesses to work on complex problems or team collaboration within a join goal, such as creating and application. An advantages of Scrum is that it is easy to understand and get to grips with but a disadvantage is that it can be difficult to master.

Within this project i will be using scrum to break down my project into smaller more managable pieces that i can more easily handle and complete, while still holding up a high standard for my project.
